            This tool will show the words remaining after each Wordle guess. You
            enter the letters of your guess using then keyboard. You then click
            on each letter to change to the color to yellow, green or grey. Each
            time you click a letter it will cycle to the next color. After the
            colors and letters match your Wordle guess, click
            <strong>Guess</strong> to reduce the word list. Repeat to continue
            to reduce the possible words remaining.

            This was designed to assist with sites such as
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a>

            The 15,918 words in this list were randomly found on the Internet
            and contains significantly more words than the official Wordle list
            or the Scrabble dictionary.

            This was loving created to scratch my own itch by
            <a href="https://findbenhere.com/">Benjamin Messick</a>. I use it
            after I have finished the day's Wordle to see how each of my guesses
            reduced the word list.
